To control the BattleButBot, simply use both **joysticks** located in the screen.

> [!NOTE]
> Before submitting a issue ticket, please use another browser as Safari is not 100% stable for a web browser controller.

## ESPNow Controller

Take a look [here](https://github.com/nguterresn/simple-esp-now-controller).

### Robot Controls

You can control BattleButBot using the joysticks from the graphical user interface (GUI). To move forward, drag the left joystick upwards, and to move backward, drag the left joystick downwards. To lean the BattleButBot to the right, drag the right joystick to the right and vice-versa.

### Settings

To configure your joystick settings, click the `Settings` button.

For ease of development while the robot firmware is in development, a console log is located at the bottom of the screen.

When ordering the BOM, make sure to order at least 5 (five!) of each component so you end up with the possibility to solder 5 different PCBs.

### Supply chain troubleshooting

‚ö†Ô∏è In case a few componenets are not available refer to the list below:

- Any ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 (NOT 1U!) should work. There are a [few variations](https://www.lcsc.com/search?q=ESP32-S3-WROOM-1) of the same footprint with more or less RAM and FLASH.
- H1-H4 componenets are mount holes, they don't need any component assigned.
- In case of resistor or capacitors shortage, it is also OK to find other supplier as long as it follows the same specification (e.g. 20k resistor 5%)

## Design

The design of the BattleButBot plays an important role. How it is designed determines how heavy (or how light) it is. Two requirements: sturdy and light.

### Cyberpunk

A cyberpunk alike robot is cold as hell. The low poly edges also make it easier to print.

## Assemble

What you need:

* 6 M3 8mm/5mm screws
* 6 Heat inserts
* The [body](https://github.com/nguterresn/battlebutbot/blob/main/body/Car.stl)
* The [lid](https://github.com/nguterresn/battlebutbot/blob/main/body/Lid.stl)
* The [front](https://github.com/nguterresn/battlebutbot/blob/main/body/Gate.stl)
* A 2S-7.4V Lithium battery
* The [PCB](https://github.com/nguterresn/battlebutbot/tree/main/board/bubblebutbot)
* The two wheels
